#### apt로 패키지 설치 중에 Y/n 커맨드 자동으로 입력하기

- `apt-get -y install [packagename]`처럼 **-y** 옵션을 붙여주면 된다.



#### screen 명령어

```
‘-m’
Tell screen to ignore the $STY environment variable. When this option is used, a new session will always be created, regardless of whether screen is being called from within another screen session or not. This flag has a special meaning in connection with the ‘-d’ option:

-d -m
Start screen in detached mode. This creates a new session but doesn’t attach to it. This is useful for system startup scripts.
```
